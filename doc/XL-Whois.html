<h2><a name="WhatIsIt">What is it</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>XL-Whois is a tool to make multiple advanced whois requests;</li>
<li>It supports Domain Whois, Network Whois and DNS Records;</li>
<li>Object for the requests are parsed from the clipboard content so time to prepare 
the request is reduced to minimum;</li>
<li>Supported objects are IPv4, hostname, domain name and IPv6. Domain extensions 
for hostname and domain name are validated from a common database that can be 
updated every time you use the tool;</li>
<li>XL-Whois stores responses from Network Whois requests in database and cache. 
The database can be imported and exported so you can share your data between 
your computer or with other people;</li>
<li>XL-Whois can also log your request that you can comment and those logs are 
stored in a database;</li>
<li>Before making a request, XL-Whois verifies your databases and informs you if 
you already made the same request and the result you got;</li>
<li>Network Whois Database can be viewed, searched, filtered, analysed and even 
data from other Network Whois report obtained by any other tool can be parsed 
and added to your database;</li>
</ul>
<p>See documentation for more details.</p>

<h2><a name="Translation">Translation</a></h2>
<h3>To translate XL-Whois to other languages:</h3>
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Config</strong> Window, use the <strong>Export Lang.ini</strong> 
function. The file will be saved in the same directory of the tool;</li>
<li>Open the file in any text editor like Notepad;</li>
<li>Translate each expression at the right of the <strong>=</strong> symbol;</li>
<ul>
<li>The expression on the left side is used by the tool to identify the expression 
so do not change it. Also, be sure to have a space between the <strong>=</strong> symbol 
and your expression (ex. Key = Value);</li>
<li>Authorized characters are alphanumerics, spaces and these symbols: ",", ".", "-", 
"!", ",", "(" and ")". Any other character will be deleted;</li>
<li>For some controls, string length must be the same as original. A longer string could 
be truncated if it doesn't match the length of the field;</li>
<li>The value associated with the <strong>translatorName</strong> will be used in 
the <strong>About</strong> window to identify you as translator (if you want). You can 
also add your email or a short url (ex. YourName (youraddress@email.com));</li>
</ul>
<li>Restart the tool so the strings in <strong>Lang.ini</strong> will be used 
instead of the default language.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you translate the tool and you want to share, contact the author.</p>
<h3>Available translations:</h3>
<p>To install, save the appropriate <strong>Lang.ini</strong> file in the same 
directory of the tool.</p>
<p>No translation available for the moment.</p>
